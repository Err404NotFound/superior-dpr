    <p>For an alternative and interdisciplinary way to complete some of their GE requirements, students may choose the Interdisciplinary General Education program, see below.</p> 

    <hr>

    <h2>Interdisciplinary General Education</h2>
      <p>An alternate pattern for partial fulfillment of GE Areas A, C, and D available for students is the Interdisciplinary General Education (IGE) program.  Students should see an advisor for specific GE coursework required by their major.  Please refer to the University Catalog General Education Program section for additional information.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>American Institutions: 6 units</h2>
      <p>Courses that satisfy this requirement may also satisfy GE areas D1 and D2.</p>
    
    <hr>

    <h2>American Cultural Perspectives Requirement: 3 units</h2>
      <p>Refer to the University Catalog General Education Program section for a list of courses that satisfy this requirement.  Course may also satisfy major, minor, GE, or unrestricted elective requirements.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Graduation Writing Test</h2>
      <p>All persons who receive undergraduate degrees from Cal Poly Pomona must pass the Graduation Writing Test (GWT).  The test must be taken by the semester following completion of 60 units for undergraduates.</p>
