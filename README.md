Start Java Spring Server:
Run command 'mvn package' from command line. This will create an executable jar file in the target directory.
Run command 'java -jar <JAR_FILE_NAME>.jar', which will start the server running on port 8080. Endpoints can be examined by navigating to localhost:8080 in a web browser.

Start the Angular app
Run command 'ng serve' once an instance of the server is running. This will start the Angular app on port 4200.
